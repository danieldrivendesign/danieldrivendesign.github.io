Over the years, I have been saving various resources that I find helpful. I figured I should share some of these with everyone!\r

\r
## Youtube:\r
\r
### Programming\r
\r
- [Git-Amend](https://www.youtube.com/@git-amend/videos) - Unity specific. Uses design patterns to create features, and also has tutorials for more "hacky" and clever approaches to working in Unity.\r
- [Zoran Horvat](https://www.youtube.com/@zoran-horvat) - General C# advice.\r
- [CodeAesthetic](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeAesthetic) - Not active. Opinionated dev who presents his ideas in a very digestible way. Good channel to see different perspectives.\r
- [ZeusGameAcademy](https://www.youtube.com/@zeusgamedevacademy) - Not just programming, but all things game dev.\r
- [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen) - Mostly entertaining. Also good for ruining how you pronounce dev terms. SQL = "Squeal", HTML = "Hitmal"\r
\r
### Art - Modeling\r
\r
- [TheDucky3D](https://www.youtube.com/@TheDucky3D)\r
\r
### Art - Shaders\r
\r
- [Acerola](https://www.youtube.com/@Acerola_t) - Technical artist who does a mix of recreating shader effects in games, explaining algorithms, and seems very addicted to the Persona games. Very fun videos.\r
- [MinionsArt](https://www.youtube.com/@MinionsArt) - A godsend for shader tutorials. I think every one should check out this channel, as well as their main site for tutorials.\r
\r
### Particle Systems / VFX\r
\r
- [GabrielAguiarProd](https://www.youtube.com/@GabrielAguiarProd) - Mostly VFX but also incorporates some modelling, shaders, and code into his projects. Another fun one even if you are not into VFX necessarily.\r
\r
## Blogs:\r
\r
- [Minions Art (Blog)](https://minionsart.github.io/tutorials/) - This is the main blog / tutorial list for Minions Art mentioned in the youtube section.\r
- [Cat Like Coding](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/) - Absolutely the best. Excellent series about movement, and a ton of fun shader / VFX tutorials.\r
\r
## Tools:\r
\r
- [Game UI Database](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/) - Everyone should go here occasionally. The best resource for getting UI ideas.\r
- [Jason Storey](https://code.jason-storey.com/snippets) - Contains a ton of common code snippets to get ideas from.\r
