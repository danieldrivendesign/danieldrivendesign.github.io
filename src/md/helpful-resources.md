# Helpful Resources

Over the years, I have been saving various resources that I find helpful. I figured I should share some of these with everyone!

---

## Youtube:

### Programming

- [Git-Amend](https://www.youtube.com/@git-amend/videos) - Unity specific. Uses design patterns to create features, and also has tutorials for more "hacky" and clever approaches to working in Unity.
- [Zoran Horvat](https://www.youtube.com/@zoran-horvat) - General C# advice.
- [CodeAesthetic](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeAesthetic) - Not active. Opinionated dev who presents his ideas in a very digestible way. Good channel to see different perspectives.
- [ZeusGameAcademy](https://www.youtube.com/@zeusgamedevacademy) - Not just programming, but all things game dev.
- [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen) - Mostly entertaining. Also good for ruining how you pronounce dev terms. SQL = "Squeal", HTML = "Hitmal"

### Art - Modeling

- [TheDucky3D](https://www.youtube.com/@TheDucky3D)

### Art - Shaders

- [Acerola](https://www.youtube.com/@Acerola_t) - Technical artist who does a mix of recreating shader effects in games, explaining algorithms, and seems very addicted to the Persona games. Very fun videos.
- [MinionsArt](https://www.youtube.com/@MinionsArt) - A godsend for shader tutorials. I think every one should check out this channel, as well as their main site for tutorials.

### Particle Systems / VFX

- [GabrielAguiarProd](https://www.youtube.com/@GabrielAguiarProd) - Mostly VFX but also incorporates some modelling, shaders, and code into his projects. Another fun one even if you are not into VFX necessarily.

## Blogs:

- [Minions Art (Blog)](https://minionsart.github.io/tutorials/) - This is the main blog / tutorial list for Minions Art mentioned in the youtube section.
- [Cat Like Coding](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/) - Absolutely the best. Excellent series about movement, and a ton of fun shader / VFX tutorials.

## Tools:

- [Game UI Database](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/) - Everyone should go here occasionally. The best resource for getting UI ideas.
- [Jason Storey](https://code.jason-storey.com/snippets) - Contains a ton of common code snippets to get ideas from.
